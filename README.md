# SDL-Thing
 Just me messing around with SDL, C++ and makefiles

# requirements
	- make
	- SDL2
	- SDL2_mixer
	- g++	

# How to make
	- cd into the folder
	- do the command "make"

# Linux
	after you make the file just run .AppImage file it makes 
	if that doesn't work read this article  http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/how-to-open-appimage-in-linux
# Windows
	After you run the make command just run the .exe file
	if you can't find the make command read this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows
# Other
	after you run the make command run the .output file by pulling it into your terminal 

you can also make a custom .desktop file for it if you want to (idk why you would this is just a test app)
